1.	What is an EBS volume?
 An EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume is a block-level storage device that you can attach to an EC2 instance. It provides persistent storage that persists independently from the life of an instance.
2.	What is the difference between EBS-backed and instance-store backed instances? 
EBS-backed instances store the root file system on an EBS volume, providing persistent storage. Instance-store backed instances use the instance's root disk that is physically attached to the host computer.
3.How can you increase the size of an EBS volume? 
You can increase the size of an EBS volume, but it requires creating a snapshot of the existing volume, then creating a larger volume from that snapshot, and finally attaching it to the instance.
4.Can you attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance?
 Yes, you can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single EC2 instance, each identified by a unique device name.
5.Explain the difference between General Purpose SSD (gp2) and Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1). 
 General Purpose SSD (gp2) provides balanced performance for a wide range of workloads. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate, making it ideal for I/O-intensive applications.
DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager):
6.	What is AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)? 
AWS Data Lifecycle Manager is a service that automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots. It helps in managing the lifecycle of your EBS volumes' backups.
7.How do you create a lifecycle policy for EBS snapshots? 
You create a lifecycle policy in the AWS DLM console or by using the DLM API. The policy defines the rules for creating and retaining snapshots, such as the frequency and retention period.
8.	Explain the concept of retention policies in DLM.
Retention policies in DLM specify how many snapshots to retain and for how long. You can set up policies to keep a certain number of snapshots, or to retain snapshots for a specific number of days.
Snapshots:
9.What is an EBS snapshot? 
An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume. It captures the data and configuration of the volume, allowing you to restore it or create new volumes from the snapshot.
10.How do you create a snapshot of an EBS volume?
 You can create a snapshot using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. You select the EBS volume, initiate the snapshot process, and it will be created asynchronously.
11.Can you create a snapshot of a root volume that is attached to a running EC2 instance?
Yes, you can create a snapshot of a root volume while it is attached to a running instance. However, it's recommended to stop the instance to ensure data consistency.
12.What is the difference between a snapshot and an AMI? 
A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume, while an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured image that can be used to launch EC2 instances. An AMI can include multiple snapshots.
